ABOUT

'Artillery' is, as the name suggests, an artillery game. To be more specific,
it is a 2-player real-time artillery game. It uses C and Allegro 5.

CONTROLS

For player 1, W/S aims and A/D moves. For player 2 it is the arrow keys. LSHIFT
/RSHIFT fires (be sure to hold to charge up), R restarts and Escape quits the
game.

COMPILING

To compile this game you will need a C compiler as well as the Allegro 5
development library and its dependencies. This game is made for Linux, but it
should compile just fine on other platforms.
